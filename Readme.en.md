# OSL Shaders

![Materiales](Img/img.png)

Here I'm going to upload shaders written in open shading language.

As currently Blender cannot use those shaders in GPU rendering, I will add versions made with Blender material nodes inside the NodeVersion folder (This allows to use them with Eevee).

In the repo <a href="../../wiki">wiki</a> i will add the calculations needed to make every shader.
